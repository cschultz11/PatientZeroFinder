# PatientZeroFinder
An advanced method of determining Patient Zero
given the square footage of a space, different individuals,
their locations in the room, and a rate of transmission. This
program is meant to demonstrate OOP skills as well as my skills in
Java from a real-world, applicable perspective.

Worked on this in my spare time, as well as a short paper regarding application of the program, choice to use Java, and background on the functions used and calculations made. Will add the paper to this repository once it is done and edited.
